# WPFramework

##What is this

This little library is what we use in our projects when we develop a Wordpress website.
It helps us to write a class for each custom post type in which is simple to define also custom taxonomy and to wrap custom fields (we use [ACF](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com)) as class members.

##Example

We will soon provide some examples of use of this library.

## Thanks

Thanks for using this.
